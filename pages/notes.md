Here are some of the notes I've written. Unless otherwise stated, all of these are works
in progress.

* [Notes on connections on principal bundles](/assets/docs/notes/principal-connections.pdf), and [exercises.](/assets/docs/notes/pc-exercises.pdf)
* [My Master's Thesis](/assets/docs/notes/seiberg-witten.pdf) in Seiberg-Witten Theory and the intersection form. I guess it's finished but ah, I wish I could've written so much more.
