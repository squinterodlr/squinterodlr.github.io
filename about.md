**Homotopico** is my personal website. Here you will find my [blog posts](/),
which are mostly loosely-threaded thoughts about things I've learned or want to
clarify in mathematics and theoretical physics.

I am Santiago Quintero de los Ríos. I am currently a PhD student 
a the [Centre for Quantum Mathematics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/qm)
at the University of Southern Denmark, in Odense. My research
project is in quantum Chern-Simons theory.

My research interests lie in mathematical physics, particularly the geometrical
aspects of fundamental physics.

I think a lot about education in maths and physics, and higher education in general.

Here's a picture of me and my dad eating fried fish in Rotterdam.

I am Santiago Quintero de los Ríos. I did my bachelor's in mathematics at the
National University of Colombia, and a bacheror's in astronomy at the University of
Antioquia, both in Medellín, Colombia. I am currently a master's student of the Mathematical
Sciences program at Utrecht University. My research interests
lie in mathematical physics, particularly the geometrical
aspects of fundamental physics.
