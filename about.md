## Homotopico

**Homotopico** is my personal website. Here you will find my [blog posts](/),
which are mostly loosely-threaded thoughts about things I've learned or want to
clarify in mathematics and theoretical physics.

## The Author
I am Santiago Quintero de los RÃ­os, master's student of the program in Mathematical
Sciences and Theoretical Physics at Utrecht University. My research interests
lie in mathematical physics, particularly the geometrical
aspects of fundamental physics.
