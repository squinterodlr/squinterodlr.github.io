This time we’re going to be more concrete. The general theory of
many-particle states can be quite tricky and unintuitive, so it’s better
to start everything with the simplest example: a 2-state system.

Last time in Homotopico, we derived the Hilbert spaces that correspond
to multiple identical particles. If a single particle is represented by
the Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H}$, then there are two kinds of
indistiguishable $k$-particle spaces: the bosonic space
$ \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H}$ and the fermionic space
$\Lambda^k \mathcal{H}$. These spaces are defined in terms of the
permutation operators $P_\sigma$ (in the previous post I called them
$T_\sigma$), which are the natural representation of the permutation
group $ \mathfrak{S}\_k$ on $\otimes^k \mathcal{H}$: for each
$\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}\_k$, define


 $$  P_\sigma{\vert \psi_1\dots\psi_k \rangle}={\vert \psi_{\sigma(1)}\dots\psi_{\sigma(k)} \rangle}.  $$


The bosonic space is composed of vectors that are *permutation
invariant*,

 $$  \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H} = {\left\{ {\vert \Psi \rangle} \in \otimes^k \mathcal{H}~:~P_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}={\vert \Psi \rangle}\quad \forall\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k\right\}}, $$

while the fermionic space is composed of vectors that are *reversed*
under odd permutations, i.e.

 $$ \Lambda^k \mathcal{H} = {\left\{ {\vert \Psi \rangle} \in \otimes^k \mathcal{H}~:~P_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}=\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma){\vert \Psi \rangle}\quad \forall\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k\right\}}. $$

It can be checked that these are indeed Hilbert spaces (we won’t do that
here). What we will do now is constructing state spaces with an
*arbitrary number of particles*, instead of a *fixed* number of
particles. Here, we will first focus on a 2-state system, for example
polarization of photons or spin-$\frac{1}{2}$.

Two states one particle {#sec:2-states-1}
=======================

When we talk about a system with $2$ states, we *really* mean that the
Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H}$ is of (complex) dimension $2$. This tells
us that we can find a basis
$\left\\{ {\vert a \rangle},{\vert b \rangle}\right\\}$, such that
${\left\langle a \middle\vert a\right\rangle}={\left\langle b \middle\vert b\right\rangle}=1$
and ${\left\langle a \middle\vert b\right\rangle}=0$. In the case of
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, ${\vert a \rangle},{\vert b \rangle}$ are
normalized eigenstates of some spin operator, often $\hat{S}_z$. In the
case of photon polarization, ${\vert a \rangle},{\vert b \rangle}$
represent states of pure horizontal or vertical polarization with
respect to some axis. What the kets ${\vert a \rangle}$ and
${\vert b \rangle}$ actually stand for (physically speaking) is
irrelevant for our discussion. What is important is that we have an
orthonormal basis that consists of $2$ vectors, which means that any
(one-particle) state in $ \mathcal{H}$ can be written as

 $$ {\vert \psi \rangle} = \alpha{\vert a \rangle} + \beta{\vert b \rangle}, $$

with $\alpha,\beta\in {\mathbb{C}}$.

2-particle states {#sec:2-particles}
=================

We now stick two of these one-particle spaces together via the tensor
product. Recall that $ \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$ is the vector
space of *linear combinations* of elements of the form
${\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}:={\vert \psi_1 \rangle}\otimes{\vert \psi_2 \rangle}$
with ${\vert \psi_1 \rangle},{\vert \psi_2 \rangle}\in  \mathcal{H}$.
Since we have a basis ${\vert a \rangle},{\vert b \rangle}$ of
$ \mathcal{H}$, we can write


$$\begin{aligned}
    {\vert \psi_1 \rangle} &= \alpha_1{\vert a \rangle} + \beta_1{\vert b \rangle}\\
    {\vert \psi_2 \rangle} &= \alpha_2{\vert a \rangle} + \beta_2{\vert b \rangle},
  \end{aligned}$$

 so that

 $$ {\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle} = (\alpha_1{\vert a \rangle} + \beta_1{\vert b \rangle})\otimes(\alpha_2{\vert a \rangle} + \beta_2{\vert b \rangle}) = \alpha_1\alpha_2{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_1\beta_2{\vert ab \rangle} + \beta_1\alpha_2{\vert ba \rangle} + \beta_1\beta_2{\vert bb \rangle}. $$

This means that, in general, *any* element of
$ \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$ can be written as a linear
combination of
${\vert aa \rangle},{\vert ab \rangle},{\vert ba \rangle},{\vert bb \rangle}$.
However, not every element of $ \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$ can be
written as ${\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}$ for some
${\vert \psi_1 \rangle},{\vert \psi_2 \rangle}\in  \mathcal{H}$. The
elements that can be written in this way are called **product states**.

If we define the inner product in $ \mathcal{H}$ as

 $$ {\left\langle \psi_1\otimes \psi_2 \middle\vert \phi_1\otimes\phi_2\right\rangle}:={\left\langle \psi_1 \middle\vert \phi_1\right\rangle}{\left\langle \psi_2 \middle\vert \phi_2\right\rangle}, $$

it can be easily shown that
$\left\\{  {\vert aa \rangle},{\vert ab \rangle},{\vert ba \rangle},{\vert bb \rangle} \right\\}$
forms an orthonormal basis of $ \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$.

We interpret the state ${\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}$ as saying
“particle 1 is in state ${\vert \psi_1 \rangle}$ and particle 2 is in
state ${\vert \psi_2 \rangle}$”. Since in general
${\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}\neq{\vert \psi_2\psi_1 \rangle}$, under
this interpretation our particles are *distinguishable*. Indeed, that’s
why it even makes sense to speak of particle 1 and particle 2.

Introducing indistinguishability {#sec:intr-indist}
--------------------------------

In the previous post, we explained that the spaces of indistinguishable
particles are those in which the permutation transformation
$P: \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$,
given by

 $$ P{\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle} := {\vert \psi_2\psi_1 \rangle}, $$
 and
extended everywhere by linearity, *is an absolute symmetry*.
Equivalently, a state
${\vert \Psi \rangle}\in  \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$ (not
necessarily a product state!) represents indistinguishable particles if
and only if
 $$ P{\vert \Psi \rangle} = \pm{\vert \Psi \rangle}. $$
 The
*bosonic* states are the ones for which
$P{\vert \Psi \rangle}={\vert \Psi \rangle}$, and the *fermionic* states
are the ones for which $P{\vert \Psi \rangle} = -{\vert \Psi \rangle}$.
In the previous post we showed that given a product state
${\vert \Psi \rangle}= {\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}$, the state

 $$ \frac{1}{2}\left({\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}+{\vert \psi_2\psi_1 \rangle}\right) $$

is a bosonic state, while

 $$ \frac{1}{2}\left({\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}-{\vert \psi_2\psi_1 \rangle}\right) $$

is a fermionic state, and neither is necessarily normalized. Indeed,
*all* the bosonic and fermionic 2-particle states are expressed as
linear combinations of elements of that form! To see this, consider an
arbitrary state ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$. We can write it in terms of the
basis as

 $$ {\vert \Psi \rangle} = \alpha_{11}{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}{\vert ab \rangle} + \alpha_{21}{\vert ba \rangle} + \alpha_{22}{\vert bb \rangle}, $$

where $\alpha_{11},\dots,\alpha_{22}\in {\mathbb{C}}$ are complex
numbers. Now we apply $P$:



$$\begin{aligned}
    P{\vert \Psi \rangle} &= \alpha_{11}P{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}P{\vert ab \rangle} + \alpha_{21}P{\vert ba \rangle} + \alpha_{22}P{\vert bb \rangle}\\
    &= \alpha_{11}{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}{\vert ba \rangle} + \alpha_{21}{\vert ab \rangle}
    + \alpha_{22}{\vert bb \rangle}.
  \end{aligned}$$


   If $P{\vert \Psi \rangle}=\pm{\vert \Psi \rangle}$,
this tells us that


$$\begin{aligned}
    \alpha_{11}&=\pm\alpha_{11}\\
    \alpha_{12}&=\pm\alpha_{21}\\
    \alpha_{22}&=\pm\alpha_{22}.
  \end{aligned}$$


   Note that if
$P{\vert \Psi \rangle}=-{\vert \Psi \rangle}$ (i.e.
${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ is fermionic), then $\alpha_{11}=-\alpha_{11}$,
which means that $\alpha_{11}=0$, and similarly $\alpha_{22}=0$.
Substituting back in ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ for the general case, we
obtain:


$$\begin{aligned}
    {\vert \Psi \rangle} &= \alpha_{11}{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}{\vert ab \rangle} + \alpha_{21}{\vert ba \rangle} + \alpha_{22}{\vert bb \rangle}\\
    &= \alpha_{11}{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}{\vert ab \rangle} \pm \alpha_{12}{\vert ba \rangle} + \alpha_{22}{\vert bb \rangle}\\
    &=\alpha_{11}{\vert aa \rangle} + \alpha_{12}\left({\vert ab \rangle} \pm {\vert ba \rangle}\right) + \alpha_{22}{\vert bb \rangle}\\
    &=\frac{\alpha_{11}}{2}({\vert aa \rangle}\pm {\vert aa \rangle}) +
    \frac{2\alpha_{12}}{2}\left({\vert ab \rangle} \pm {\vert ba \rangle}\right) +
    \frac{\alpha_{22}}{2}({\vert bb \rangle}\pm{\vert bb \rangle}),\qquad (\star)
  \end{aligned}$$

   and therefore indeed ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ is a
linear combination of elements of the form

 $$ \frac{1}{2}({\vert \psi_1\psi_2 \rangle}\pm{\vert \psi_2\psi_1 \rangle}). $$

In particular, we can find bases for the boson and fermion 2-particle
states. From equation $(\star)$ we see that a basis for the boson space
is given by

 $$ {\vert aa \rangle},\quad \frac{1}{2}({\vert ab \rangle}+{\vert ba \rangle}),\quad{\vert bb \rangle}. $$

and so the boson space has dimension $3$. We can now *orthonormalize*
this basis, to obtain a (you guessed it), orthonormal basis. It turns
out that these three elements are already orthogonal, and
${\vert aa \rangle},{\vert bb \rangle}$ are already normalized (why?) so
we only need to normalize the remaining one. This means that we have to
calculate its norm:


$$\begin{aligned}
    \|({\vert ab \rangle}+{\vert ba \rangle})\|^2 & ={\left\langle ab+ba \middle\vert ab+ba\right\rangle}\\
    &=\left({\left\langle ab \middle\vert ab\right\rangle} + {\left\langle ab \middle\vert ba\right\rangle} + {\left\langle ba \middle\vert ab\right\rangle} +{\left\langle ba \middle\vert ba\right\rangle}\right)\\
    &=\left({\left\langle a \middle\vert a\right\rangle}{\left\langle b \middle\vert b\right\rangle} + {\left\langle a \middle\vert b\right\rangle}{\left\langle b \middle\vert a\right\rangle} + {\left\langle b \middle\vert a\right\rangle}{\left\langle a \middle\vert b\right\rangle} +{\left\langle b \middle\vert b\right\rangle}{\left\langle a \middle\vert a\right\rangle}\right)\\
    &=(1+0+0+1)\\
    &=2,
  \end{aligned}$$

   And this tells us that the normalized state is

 $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\vert ab \rangle}+{\vert ba \rangle}). $$
 We have
now obtained an orthonormal basis for the boson space, which we call the
**occupation number basis**. We define it as


$$\begin{aligned}
    {\vert 2,0 \rangle} &:= {\vert aa \rangle}\\
    {\vert 1,1 \rangle} &:= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\vert ab \rangle}+{\vert ba \rangle})\\
    {\vert 0,2 \rangle} &:= {\vert bb \rangle}.
  \end{aligned}$$

   We interpret ${\vert 2,0 \rangle}$ as a state with two
particles in state ${\vert a \rangle}$ and no particles in state
${\vert b \rangle}$, ${\vert 1,1 \rangle}$ as a state with one particle
in each state${\vert a \rangle},{\vert b \rangle}$, and
${\vert 0,2 \rangle}$ as a state with no particles in state
${\vert a \rangle}$ and two particles in state ${\vert b \rangle}$ (see image
  below).

![](/assets/posts/fock-2-state/2-state-boson.png)

Similarly, from equation $(\star)$ for fermions, we see that a basis is
given by the single element

 $$ {\vert ab \rangle} = \frac{1}{2}({\vert ab \rangle}-{\vert ba \rangle}). $$

Therefore we conclude that the fermion space is $1$-dimensional. We can
normalize this state to obtain the **occupation number basis** for
fermions (which in this case is a single, lonely state):

 $$ {\vert 1,1 \rangle} := \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\vert ab \rangle}-{\vert ba \rangle}). $$

Note that there are *no other* independent states, and unlike the
bosonic case, we don’t have states that represent two particle in the
same state. For fermions, no two particles are ever in the same state:
this is called **Pauli’s exclusion principle**.

3-particle states {#sec:3-particle-states}
=================

Instead of jumping to the general $n$-particle case, we will consider
the 3-particle states. Here, the permutations are much more complicated,
and so a thorough understanding of this case will give us a good
intuition to work on the general case.

Our “distinguishable” 3-particle space is
$\otimes^3 \mathcal{H}= \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}\otimes \mathcal{H}$,
which is the vector space of *linear combinations* of elements of the
form
${\vert \psi_1\psi_2\psi_3 \rangle}={\vert \psi_1 \rangle}\otimes{\vert \psi_2 \rangle}\otimes{\vert \psi_3 \rangle}$
for ${\vert \psi_j \rangle}\in  \mathcal{H}$. Following the exact same
procedure as above, we can see that any element of
$\otimes^3 \mathcal{H}$ can be expressed as


$$\begin{aligned}
    {\vert \Psi \rangle} &=\phantom{+} \alpha_{111}{\vert aaa \rangle} + \alpha_{112}{\vert aab \rangle} + \alpha_{121}{\vert aba \rangle} + \alpha_{122}{\vert abb \rangle}\\
    &\phantom{=} + \alpha_{211}{\vert baa \rangle} + \alpha_{212}{\vert bab \rangle} +
    \alpha_{221}{\vert bba \rangle} +\alpha_{222}{\vert bbb \rangle},
  \end{aligned}$$

   for $\alpha_{ijk}\in {\mathbb{C}}$, and $i,j,k =1,2$.


Introducing indistinguishability {#sec:intr-indist-3}
--------------------------------

Here’s where things get tricky, since there are many more permutations.
This means that we need to introduce a little bit more notation. Recall
that a **permutation** of $k$ numbers is a function $\sigma$ that
reorders the set $(1,2,\dots,k)$. For example, the function defined as
$\sigma(1)=2$, $\sigma(2)=3$ and $\sigma(3)=1$ is a permutation of
$(1,2,3)$. We may write it more concisely as $\sigma = (2,3,1)$, or in
general, $\sigma = (\sigma(1),\dots,\sigma(k))$ for a permutation of $k$
numbers. The set of all permutations of $k$ numbers is denoted by
$ \mathfrak{S}\_k$. It can be shown that it is a group under
composition, and that it has exactly $k!$ elements.

Now in the case of $3$ particles, we need to consider permutations of
$3$ numbers. There are $3!=6$ such permutations, namely:

$$\begin{align*}
    (1,2,3) \quad (3,1,2) \quad (2,3,1) \\
    (1,3,2) \quad (2,1,3) \quad (3,2,1)
\end{align*}.$$

Let’s recall the natural action of $ \mathfrak{S}\_3 $ on
$\otimes^3 \mathcal{H}$. For each $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}\_3 $, define
an operator $P\_\sigma$ which acts on *product states* as

 $$ P_\sigma{\vert \psi_1\psi_2\psi_3 \rangle}={\vert \psi_{\sigma(1)}\psi_{\sigma(2)}\psi_{\sigma(3)} \rangle}. $$

This action is extended by linearity everywhere else (recall that not
all elements are product states!). As a particular example, choose
$\sigma = (3,1,2)$. So we have

 $$ P_\sigma{\vert \psi_1\psi_2\psi_3 \rangle}={\vert \psi_{3}\psi_{1}\psi_{2} \rangle}. $$

To be a bit more explicit, suppose
${\vert \Psi \rangle}= {\vert aba \rangle}-2{\vert bba \rangle}$. Then

 $$ P_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}=P_\sigma{\vert aba \rangle}-2P_\sigma{\vert bba \rangle} = {\vert aab \rangle}-2{\vert baa \rangle}. $$


As before, in order to talk about indistinguishability, we need to
restrict ourselves to a subspace of $\otimes^3 \mathcal{H}$ where the
action of $ \mathfrak{S}\_3$ is an *absolute unitary symmetry*. In the
previous post we showed that the only way is if either

 $$ P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle} = {\vert \Psi \rangle}, $$
 which is the
bosonic case, or if

 $$ P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle} = (\operatorname{sgn}\sigma){\vert \Psi \rangle}, $$

which is the fermionic case.

Same as before, we will find an explicit basis for these bosonic and
fermionic subspaces. In this case the fermionic subspace is quite simple
(perhaps *too* simple!), so we will start with it. Write
${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ again as


$$
\begin{aligned}
    {\vert \Psi \rangle} &=\phantom{+} \alpha_{111}{\vert aaa \rangle} + \alpha_{112}{\vert aab \rangle} + \alpha_{121}{\vert aba \rangle} + \alpha_{122}{\vert abb \rangle}\\
    &\phantom{=} + \alpha_{211}{\vert baa \rangle} + \alpha_{212}{\vert bab \rangle} +
    \alpha_{221}{\vert bba \rangle} +\alpha_{222}{\vert bbb \rangle},
  \end{aligned},
$$

   and suppose that for *all*
${\sigma \in  \mathfrak{S}\_3}$,
$P\_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}=(\operatorname{sgn}\sigma){\vert \Psi \rangle}$.
The sign of a permutation of $3$ numbers is $1$ if it is an cyclic
permutation of $(1,2,3)$, and $-1$ if it is a cyclic permutation of
$(1,3,2)$, as in below.

![](/assets/posts/fock-2-state/3-perm-sgn.png){:height="228px" width="600px"}.

For example, consider $\sigma = (1,3,2)$, for which
$\operatorname{sgn}\sigma = -1$. Note that $\sigma$ switches the
elements $2$ and $3$. Then we have


$$\begin{aligned}
    P_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle} &=\phantom{+} \alpha_{111}{\vert aaa \rangle} + \alpha_{112}{\vert aba \rangle} + \alpha_{121}{\vert aab \rangle} + \alpha_{122}{\vert abb \rangle}\\
    &\phantom{=} + \alpha_{211}{\vert baa \rangle} + \alpha_{212}{\vert bba \rangle} +
    \alpha_{221}{\vert bab \rangle} +\alpha_{222}{\vert bbb \rangle}.
  \end{aligned}$$

   However, we also need
$P\_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}=-{\vert \Psi \rangle}$, so comparing above
this implies that


$$\begin{aligned}
  \alpha_{111} &= -\alpha_{111} & \alpha_{122}&=-\alpha_{122} & \alpha_{211} &=-\alpha_{211} & \alpha_{222} &=-\alpha_{222}\\
  & & \alpha_{112} &= -\alpha_{121} & \alpha_{212}&=-\alpha_{221}, & &\end{aligned}$$


and so $\alpha_{111}=\alpha_{122}=\alpha_{211}=\alpha_{222}=0$. Thus we
write ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ as

 $$ {\vert \Psi \rangle} = \alpha_{112}({\vert aab \rangle}-{\vert aba \rangle}) + \alpha_{212}({\vert bab \rangle}-{\vert bba \rangle}). $$

Now we consider $\sigma = (3,1,2)$, which is simply a cyclic permutation
of $(1,2,3)$, and so $\operatorname{sgn}\sigma = 1$. We then have

 $$ P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle} = \alpha_{112}({\vert baa \rangle}-{\vert aab \rangle}) + \alpha_{212}({\vert bba \rangle}-{\vert abb \rangle}) ={\vert \Psi \rangle}, $$

and this again tells us that $\alpha_{112}=-\alpha_{112}$ and
$\alpha_{212}=-\alpha_{212}$, so $\alpha_{112}=\alpha_{212}=0$.
Therefore ${\vert \Psi \rangle}=0$ (!). This tells us that **there are
no 3-particle fermionic states** if the single-particle space has only
$2$ states! We see this again as a case of **Pauli’s exclusion
principle**: there cannot be two particles in the same state, but if we
have $3$ particles that have to fit into only 2 states!

The bosonic case is a little bit more tedious, but let’s get to it.
Again, expand $\Psi$ in terms of the basis vectors, and let’s impose
$P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}={\vert \Psi \rangle}$ for all
$\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}\_3$. Let’s consider a small term, for example
$\alpha_{112}{\vert aab \rangle}$. Applying $P_{\sigma}$, we obtain
$\alpha_{112}{\vert baa \rangle}$, but the *original* coefficient that
goes next to ${\vert baa \rangle}$ in the expansion of
${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ is $\alpha_{211}$, so this tells us that

 $$ \alpha_{112}=\alpha_{211}. $$
 Similarly, when we apply, for example
$\sigma = (1,3,2)$ (as above!) we must have $\alpha_{112}=\alpha_{121}$.
Therefore $\alpha_{112}=\alpha_{211}=\alpha_{121}$. Applying this exact
same analysis, but to the term $\alpha_{221}{\vert bba \rangle}$, we
obtain that $\alpha_{221}=\alpha_{212}=\alpha_{122}$, so that
${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ can be written as:

 $$ {\vert \Psi \rangle}  = \alpha_{111}{\vert aaa \rangle} +\alpha_{112}({\vert aab \rangle}+{\vert aba \rangle}+{\vert baa \rangle}) + \alpha_{221}({\vert bba \rangle}+{\vert bab \rangle} + {\vert abb \rangle}) +\alpha_{222}{\vert bbb \rangle}. $$

This tells is that the subspace of bosonic states is generated by four
vectors, namely:

 $$ {\vert aaa \rangle}; \qquad {\vert aab \rangle}+{\vert aba \rangle}+{\vert baa \rangle};\qquad {\vert bba \rangle}+{\vert bab \rangle} + {\vert abb \rangle}; \text{ and}\qquad {\vert bbb \rangle}. $$

Note that each of these elements is the sum over all the possible
permutations of one of its terms. For example, the element
${\vert aab \rangle}+{\vert aba \rangle}+{\vert baa \rangle}$ is the sum
over all permutations of ${\vert aab \rangle}$. In the case of
${\vert aaa \rangle}$ and ${\vert bbb \rangle}$, all permutations of
them are themselves again! This is also true for the case of two
particles: each of the basis elements of the bosonic space is the sum
over all permutations of $2$ numbers (of which there are only two!) of
the different basis elements.

Now, similarly as above, we normalize these four vectors (they are
already orthogonal, why?), and obtain an orthonormal basis



$$\begin{aligned}
  {\vert 3,0 \rangle} &:= {\vert aaa \rangle},\\
  {\vert 2,1 \rangle} &:= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left({\vert aab \rangle}+{\vert aba \rangle}+{\vert baa \rangle}\right),\\
  {\vert 1,2 \rangle} &:= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left({\vert bba \rangle}+{\vert bab \rangle} + {\vert abb \rangle}\right),\\
  {\vert 0,3 \rangle} &:= {\vert bbb \rangle}.\end{aligned}$$

   Once
again, we interpret ${\vert 3,0 \rangle}$ as a state where there are
$3$-particles in state ${\vert a \rangle}$ and no particles in
${\vert b \rangle}$; we interpret ${\vert 2,1 \rangle}$ as a state with
$2$ particles in state ${\vert a \rangle}$ and one in state
${\vert b \rangle}$, and so on.

![](/assets/posts/fock-2-state/3-state-boson.png)

Once again, note that these *are not the only states*. Any linear
combination of
${\vert 3,0 \rangle},{\vert 2,1 \rangle},{\vert 1,2 \rangle},{\vert 0,3 \rangle}$
is again a valid bosonic state!

These examples should now give us a good foothold for...

The general case {#sec:general-case}
================

Now we will consider a general Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H}$ that allows
for a countable basis. We will call the tensor product
$\otimes^{k} \mathcal{H}$ the $k$-particle state *without statistics*.

Symmetrization and antisymmetrization (or bosonization and fermonization, if you will) {#sec:symm-or-boson}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our previous analysis gives us a suggestion: on
$\otimes^k \mathcal{H}$, define the ***symmetrization operator***
${\pi_{+}}:\otimes^{k} \mathcal{H}\to  \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H}$ as

 $$ {\pi_{+}}{\vert \Psi \rangle} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}. $$

This operator returns the sum over all possible permutations of
${\vert \Psi \rangle}$, and we add the $1/k!$ to counteract some
overcounting. For example, if we apply $\pi_+$ to ${\vert aaa \rangle}$,
we have that $P_{\sigma}{\vert aaa \rangle}={\vert aaa \rangle}$ for all
$\sigma$, and therefore we are repeating the sum over the same element
$3!=6$ times, so the $1/3!$ gets rid of that. Our previous analysis
suggests that for *any* element
${\vert \Psi \rangle}\in \otimes^k \mathcal{H}$, its symmetrization is
a bosonic state, i.e.
$\pi_+{\vert \Psi \rangle}\in  \mathcal{S}^{k} \mathcal{H}$, since any
bosonic state can be written as a linear combination of elements of the
form $\pi_+{\vert \Psi \rangle}$ (at least, we showed this for $k=2$ and
$k=3$ in the case $ \mathcal{H}\cong {\mathbb{C}}^2$ is a $2$-state
system). This means that for all $\sigma'\in  \mathfrak{S}\_k$, applying
$P_{\sigma'}$ to a symmetrized state should yield the same state:


$$\begin{aligned}
    P_{\sigma'}({\pi_{+}}{\vert \Psi \rangle}) &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}P_{\sigma'}P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}P_{\sigma' \sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= {\pi_{+}}{\vert \Psi \rangle}.
  \end{aligned}$$

   The third equality follows from the fact that the set
$\left\\{ \sigma'\sigma\vert \sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}\_k \right\\}$ is
precisely $ \mathfrak{S}\_k$. This is true since for fixed $\sigma'$,
since $\sigma = \sigma'(\sigma'^{-1}\sigma)$, every element in
$ \mathfrak{S}\_k$ is of the form $\sigma'\sigma$. Then
${\pi_{+}}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\in  \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H}$, as
promised.

Similarly, we can define the **antisymmetrization operator**
$\pi_-:\otimes^{k} \mathcal{H}\to \Lambda^{k} \mathcal{H}$ as

 $$ \pi_-{\vert \Psi \rangle} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}. $$

Indeed, applying $\pi_-$ to a vector ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ returns an
antisymmetric state (i.e. a fermionic state). This means that applying a
permutation operator $P_{\sigma'}$ to an antisymmetrized state should
yield the same state times the sign of the permutation:

$$\begin{aligned}
    P_{\sigma'}({\pi_{-}}{\vert \Psi \rangle}) &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)P_{\sigma'}P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}{\sigma}P_{\sigma' \sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}({\sigma'}^{-1}\sigma)P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\quad(\star)\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma')\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}  \\
    &= \frac{\operatorname{sgn}{\sigma'}}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma')\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)P_{\sigma}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &=\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma'){\pi_{-}}{\vert \Psi \rangle}.
  \end{aligned}$$

   The passing to equation $(\star)$ follows from
performing a “change of variables” $\sigma\to \sigma'^{-1}\sigma$. This
change of variables is legitimate since, again
$\left\\{ \sigma'^{-1}\sigma\vert\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k \right\\}= \mathfrak{S}\_k$.

Then, as expected, applying the (anti)symmetrization operator on a
vector returns an element of the (anti)symmetric space. But even more,
these (anti)symmetrization operators *precisely* define the bosonic and
fermionic spaces; that is,

$$\begin{aligned}
    S^{k} \mathcal{H} &= {\pi_{+}}(\otimes^k \mathcal{H}).\\
    \Lambda^{k} \mathcal{H} &= {\pi_{-}}(\otimes^k \mathcal{H}).
  \end{aligned}$$

   Which is to say, every (anti)symmetric vector is the
(anti)symmetrization of some other vector. One of the inclusions we
already proved, the other follows from noting, a little bit trivially,
that if ${\vert \Psi \rangle}\in  \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H}$, then

$$\begin{aligned}
    {\pi_{+}}{\vert \Psi \rangle} &=\frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}P_\sigma{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &= \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in  \mathfrak{S}_k}{\vert \Psi \rangle}\\
    &={\vert \Psi \rangle},
  \end{aligned}$$

  and similarly for $\Lambda^k \mathcal{H}$. The
antisymmetrization operator (and in general the fermion space) has a few
caveats, though. Note that above we saw that the fermion space of $3$
particles for a $2$-state system is... problematic. We can’t fit 3
Pauli-excluding particles in $2$ states, so the whole thing collapses to
zero. This is in fact a general feature of fermionic spaces of
*finite*-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Specifically, if $ \mathcal{H}$ is $n$-dimensional, then for all $k>n$,
we have $\Lambda^k \mathcal{H}=\left\\{ 0 \right\\}$.

To see this consider the case $k=n+1$. Consider an orthonormal basis
$\left\\{  {\vert \xi_1 \rangle},\dots,{\vert \xi_n \rangle} \right\\}$ of
$ \mathcal{H}$. Now let’s try to take $\Lambda^{n+1} \mathcal{H}$. As
we saw above, any element of $\Lambda^{n+1} \mathcal{H}$ is the
antisymmetrization of something else, so let’s take and element of the
natural basis of $\oplus^{n+1} \mathcal{H}$. This element is of the
form
 $$ {\vert \xi_{i_1}\dots\xi_{i_{n+1}} \rangle}. $$
 However, since
there are more “slots” than vectors that we can fill them with ($k>n$),
there must be *some* repeated elements. For example, we might take

 $$ {\vert \Psi \rangle}={\vert \xi_1\xi_1\xi_2\xi_3\dots\xi_n \rangle}, $$

where $\xi_1$ is repeated so that it fills up all the slots. When take
the antisymmetrization of ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$, something happens
which is illustrated with the following example: consider the identity
permutation $\sigma=(1,2,3,\dots,n)$, which *does nothing* and the one
that transposes the first two elements $\sigma'=(2,1,3,4,\dots,n)$.
These two differ by a transposition, so
$\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)=-\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma')$, and therefore
when we add everything we will obtain two terms

 $$ \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)P_{\sigma}{\vert \xi_1\xi_1\xi_2\xi_3\dots\xi_n \rangle} + \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma')P_{\sigma'}{\vert \xi_1\xi_1\xi_2\xi_3\dots\xi_n \rangle}= {\vert \xi_1\xi_1\xi_2\xi_3\dots\xi_n \rangle} - {\vert \xi_1\xi_1\xi_2\xi_3\dots\xi_n \rangle} = 0. $$

The action of $\sigma'$ on ${\vert \Psi \rangle}$ is exactly the same as
the one of $\sigma$, precisely because of the repeated elements. This
tells us, more generally, that

 $$ \pi_-{\vert \psi_1\dots \xi\dots \xi\dots \psi_{n} \rangle} = 0, $$

whenever there are repeated elements. This, as above, happens because
for every permutation $\sigma$, there is another permutation $\sigma'$
which differs from $\sigma$ by only one transposition, which precisely
transposes the places where the repeated elements land. Thus, everything
collapses to zero.

This is again Pauli’s exclusion principle: If you have $n$ states but
$k>n$ particles that cannot share the same state, you cannot fit them
all!

The Fock space
==============

Now that we have the spaces for $k$ identical particles, we might want
to extend it to hold *infinitely many*!

But first, let’s first consider a space that allows for arbitrarily many
particles *without statistics*. This can be done by defining the **Fock
space** (without statistics) $ \mathcal{F}( \mathcal{H})$ as the
direct sum

 $$  \mathcal{F}( \mathcal{H}) = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty}\otimes^k \mathcal{H}, $$

where the “$0$-th level” is $\otimes^0 \mathcal{H}:= {\mathbb{C}}$. To
be clear, this is the *analytic* direct sum, i.e. the vector space of
sequences $(a_0,a_1,\dots)$, with $a_k\in \otimes^k \mathcal{H}$, such
that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty\|a_k\|^2<\infty$. We also might write the
sequence $(a_0,a_1,\dots)$ as a sum $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k$, again with
each $a_k\in \otimes^k \mathcal{H}$. This is a *direct sum*, so the
elements of different number $k$ do not interact with one another.

The inner product on $ \mathcal{F}( \mathcal{H})$ is defined as
${\left\langle a \middle\vert b\right\rangle}:=\sum_{k=0}^\infty{\left\langle a_k \middle\vert b_k\right\rangle}$,
thus forming the Hilbert space[^1] that we want.

In this Fock space, define the **vacuum** state, denoted by
${\vert 0 \rangle}$ or ${\vert \Omega \rangle}$, as

 $$ {\vert 0 \rangle}={\vert 0,0,\dots \rangle}:=1\in \otimes^0 \mathcal{H}={\mathbb{C}}. $$

This represents a state with *no particles at all*. Do not confuse the
ground state ${\vert 0 \rangle}$ with the zero-vector
$0\in  \mathcal{H}$ or the element $0\in {\mathbb{C}}$!

Similarly, we can consider the **boson and fermion fock spaces**,
$ \mathcal{F}\_+( \mathcal{H})$ and $ \mathcal{F}\_-( \mathcal{H})$,
respectively, as

$$\begin{aligned}
   \mathcal{F}_+( \mathcal{H}) &:= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \mathcal{S}^k \mathcal{H}\\
   \mathcal{F}_-( \mathcal{H}) &:= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty\Lambda^k \mathcal{H}.\end{aligned}$$

Since this might be quite too abstract, let’s give examples of elements
of each space. Suppose that $ \mathcal{H}$ has an infinite countable
basis $\left\\{  {\vert \xi_n \rangle} \right\\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ (these may
be, for example, energy eigenstates for a good Hamiltonian, like the
harmonic oscillator or the infinite square potential). We take an
infinite-dimensional space to avoid the collapse of the fermionic spaces
that we described above.

The simplest elements of these spaces are simply *finite* sums of
elements of each component space. This guarantees the sum of the squared
norms to be convergent.

For a non-trivial element of $ \mathcal{F}( \mathcal{H})$ which is
neither bosonic nor fermionic, consider

 $$ {\vert \Psi \rangle} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}{\vert \xi_1\dots\xi_n \rangle} = {\vert 0 \rangle} + \frac{1}{2}{\vert \xi_1 \rangle}+\frac{1}{4}{\vert \xi_1\xi_2 \rangle} + \dots $$

Indeed, the $n$-th term of this (formal) sum is
$a_n=2^{-n}{\vert \xi_1\dots\xi_n \rangle}\in\otimes^n \mathcal{H}$,
and it satisfies

 $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \|a_k\|^2 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^{2n}}{\left\langle \xi_1\dots\xi_k \middle\vert \xi_1\dots\xi_k\right\rangle} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{2n}} <\infty. $$

Now for a nontrivial bosonic element, we can simply consider

 $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^n}\pi_+{\vert \xi_1\dots\xi_n \rangle} ={\vert 0 \rangle} +\frac{1}{2}{\vert \xi_1 \rangle}+ \frac{1}{4\cdot 2!}({\vert \xi_1\xi_2 \rangle}+{\vert \xi_2\xi_1 \rangle}) + \frac{1}{8\cdot 3!}({\vert \xi_1\xi_2\xi_3 \rangle} + \dots + {\vert \xi_3\xi_2\xi_1 \rangle}) +\dots. $$

Similarly, for a fermionic element,

 $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^n}\pi_-{\vert \xi_1\dots\xi_n \rangle} ={\vert 0 \rangle} +\frac{1}{2}{\vert \xi_1 \rangle}+ \frac{1}{4\cdot 2!}({\vert \xi_1\xi_2 \rangle}-{\vert \xi_2\xi_1 \rangle}) + \frac{1}{8\cdot 3!}({\vert \xi_1\xi_2\xi_3 \rangle} + \dots - {\vert \xi_3\xi_2\xi_1 \rangle}) +\dots. $$

Note that these examples are not normalized. We may, however, normalize
them since their norms are finite.

These examples might look contrived, but they are general elements of
the total Fock spaces. However, physicists use Fock spaces in terms of a
specific basis that is induced by a basis of $\mathcal{H}$. This
induced basis is a generalization (and completion) of the bases
${\vert 2,0 \rangle},{\vert 1,1 \rangle},{\vert 0,2 \rangle}$, etc.,
that we found above, and is sometimes called the **occupation number
basis** or **occupation number representation**. The occupation number
basis makes it easier to solve the counting problems that are needed for
statistical mechanics, and we will discuss it in depth in a future post.

In summary {#sec:summary}
==========

We presented bosonization and fermionization operators that act on the
spaces of $k$ *distinguishable* particles and output bosonic or
fermionic states. We also saw that Pauli’s exclusion principle is
general: fermionic particles can never share the same state, and this
means that if the dimension of the one-particle state space is finite
(say of dimension $n$), then the fermionic space of $k>n$ particles is
*meaningless*.

We also constructed (algebraically) a space that can represent states
with an *arbitrary* number of particles, in the bosonic, fermionic, and
without statistics flavors.

What comes next is to describe *how to work* and do interesting stuff
with the Fock spaces, and hopefully this fun will take us all the way to
the idea of a *quantum field*.
